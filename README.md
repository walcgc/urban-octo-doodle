public repo for cadet tools

copy repo-query-extractor.py in project folder and just run it 
'python repo-query-extractor.py'
that's it. 
2 files should appear the csv file and log file
delimiter used is "|" not commas "," because SQL queries have commas. I might be wrong with my reasoning though. 

pls tell me if there are errors. 
There are known errors like going through config files but might've been fixed already. 

please check your work, not sure if it gets everything, but I think it does.
